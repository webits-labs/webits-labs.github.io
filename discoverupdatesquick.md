# Quick and easy way to update apps using Discover Store without leaving GameMode

## Story:
In a recent thread about keeping apps/system files updated using Discover Store; 
A redditor recently dropped a comment about updating their apps using Discover, without having to switch back and forth from Desktop mode
Their solution was tested and it works just as expected and can be accomplished as follows

## Steps:
1. Switch to Desktop Mode and add Discover Store as a non steam game by following the standard protocol for adding non steam games (link)<addnonsteamgame.md>
2. Switch back to game mode
3. Open Discover Store -> edit controller properties -> add mouse control to the right touchpad for functionality
4. Test Discover is functioning properly in GameMode:
   - Apply existing updates
   - Check for and apply new updates
   - Search for an application/game
   - Install an application/game
To exit Discover Store, press the "Steam" button -> click "Exit Game"

## Conclusion:
So now moving forward whenever you want to check the Discover store for updates or install a new application, head over to your Discover Store  in GameMode
There is no difference between applying updates in GameMode vs Desktop Mode
