# Change controller templates from default 

## Story:
Recently I downloaded and tested the emulator "1964" to be able to play N64 games "Goldeneye" and "Perfect Dark" using standard WSAD+Mouse controls. 
Spolier: It works great, and is now my go to method to play these games.  For those interested, link to <1964emulator.md> to configure on your deck
A step in that guide included a setting to change the controller template to a customized one made specifically for the deck to work with Goldeneye and Perfect Dark respectively
Since changing the default controller is often overlooked and can appear confusing, below is a quick overview on how to change default configurations

## Step 1:
1. Select the game you wish to change controller templates
2. click the controller icon to open controller settings
3. Make note the current template, by default most games use "Gamepad" as the default, which works great for games with native support such as EmuDeck
4. click the big bar with the template name and the ">" icon on the far right to switch templates
5. Push the "x" button on your gamepad to enable "show all templates"
6. Browsing the top row from left to right:
   - Your Layouts: Your currently used/modified template for the game
   - Templates: Controller layouts created/supported by Valve
       - For example, the EmuDeck template is located under "Templates"
   - Community Layouts: Controller layouts created and uploaded by 3rd parties, unofficially supported by valve and/or the original creator
   - Search: Search keyword strings for a specific keyboard layout if unable to find one that matches your needs

## Step 2:
Once you have found a template you wish to apply, follow the steps below to apply it:
1. Press the "A" button on your gamepad to select and download the controller template
2. Press the "x" button on your gamepad to apply the template as the active template
3. Confirm template name now matches the name of the newly downloaded template and the buttons match the expected layout

## Conclusion:
You now have a custom controller template applied to your game.  You can further customize this layout by modifying any of the keys to match your specific requirements such as:
- Assigning back button shortcuts
- Re-assigning triggers to face buttons (I.E. older racing games that use "x" or "a" for accelleration/breaking instead of R2/L2)
- Converting one trackpad (I.E. the right trackpad) to function as a traditional mouse wih Left+Right click functionality
- Creating custom Action Sets and Menus, useful for customizing emulator settings from within EmuDeck
