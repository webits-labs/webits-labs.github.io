# How to install Decky Loader for Steam Deck:

## Story:
I much prefer to keep my Steam Deck as stock as possible, so that it can behave more as a console first, and a PC second.  Therefore, I tend not to deviate away
from the Stable channel update, nor do I like "hacking" my deck to install or in any way run unauthorized software that may get wiped away with a future update.

However, when there exists such a tool that makes the overall use of the deck just that much better, that is supported, atleast via a 3rd party community, its 
difficult to overlook.
