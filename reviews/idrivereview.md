# Why I recommend iDrive

## Story
I have been using iDrive for the better part of a year now, and suffice to say using it is an over statement.  And I mean that in the best way possible.  It does its job of keeping a copy of my data offsite,
and it does it well. I can access the contents of my idrive from the web, mobile app, as well as desktop apps for MacOS and Windows.  Their customer experience has been 1st rate, every question asked so far was
met with understanding and intellectual response.  Their reps werecurtious and understood the application from a technical level, which was great as my calls have led to some very valuable conversations about
the product.  But for me, I can break down why I recommend iDrive into 5 simple reasons:

1. Reason 1 - iDrive feels like an extension of your local storage
2. Reason 2 - Backup and Restore to physical media shipped from their door to yours and back
3. Reason 3 - Seamless web and app access to your data
4. Reason 4 - Scheduled backups
5. Reason 5 - Cost effective

Let me elaborate on that a little.  I was looking for a new way to keep a copy of my critical data offsite, in the event of an emergency.  After researching the available options,
I ended up giving iDrive a go based on the reviews, forum feedback, customer support, available options, and cost. Which is a great segway into reason # 5; at the time of this writing, and the time I 
purchased my subscription, iDrive is offering up to 5TB of storage for 1 year at only $9.95.  5TB was perfect as that was the same size of drive the data I wanted backed up was on.  

# As of time of this writing, price is still $9.95 for 1 year of 5TB storage
- Check out https://www.idrive.com/ to see current pricing.

After the first year, the price is only $70 year for 5TB of cloud storage, which, for piece of mind, is not a high price to consume.  This essentially breaks down to $5.83 per month, which is about the same
as 1 year of 1TB OneDrive storage from Microsoft as part of their Microsoft 365 Personal plan (also $70 per year as of the time of this writing)

Lastly, for costs, iDrive offers a physical drive to be shipped to your door in the form of iDrive Express in the event of an emergency restore.  Should you only need to download individual files, you can do so via their web or desktop
apps free of charge, using your internet bandwidth to download your file(s).  However, should you need to restore all of your data, and downloading is not going to be the most effective route,
you can request a hard drive from iDrive.  They provide 1 shipment per year at no cost, and each subsequent shipment that year will only cost $60.  

Which leads me to reason #2, if you are anything like me, the thought of uploading 5TB to the cloud seemed like a fruitless endevour.  Even with decent internet, I have about 500 MB Down but only around 20 MB Up.
(Which is probably the fastest my upload has ever been).  But doing the math, even at 20 MB, uploading 5TB would take a couple of months if left to upload 24 hours a day 7 days a week, and I wasn't interested 
in that.  Thankfully, iDrive Express includes 1 free drive shipment to your door for uploading your data onto physical media.  The process to setup an iDrive account has been documented [here](https://webits-labs.github.io/deckdocs/idrivesetup)

As mentioned above, this is only one way in which iDrive feels like an extension of your local storage.  Per Reason #1, the iDrive software running on your computer opens a portal to your cloud storage, where 
managing your existing and future backups is handled, as well as having to do any individual restores,  Paired with reason #4, you can automate your backups to monitor specific folders and files on your computer,
then via a trigger, whether that be a time/day, or modification flag, iDrive will upload a copy of the changes right into your iDrive cloud account. 

And thats not all, but paired with Reason #3, you can access all of this data from any device, anytime as long as you have internet access and can login to your account.  Mobile apps are available for iOS and 
Android, native apps for MacOS and Windows, and all data can be accessed via the iDrive web portal from any modern web browswer on any operating system, including Linux.

## Conclusion
This is an unsponsored commentary of my own personal experiences with iDrive and why I personally recommend it when asked as it's a superb little home and small business cloud backup solution.  For those who might want to
give it a try before commiting, iDrive also includes a free tier, with up to 10GB of free storage, which is actually more than either Microsoft or Google are offering as part of their free tier storage at the time
this writing!
