# Setting up iDrive for the first time

## Getting started using iDrive
1. Installing the iDrive Backup Software on your computer.  iDrive supports MacOS, Windows client and Windows Server.
2. Create account and purchase 1 year of 5TB iDrive cloud storage
3. From within iDrive software, proceed to iDrive Express section
4. Request your drive by fillign out your information including name and address
5. Once drive arrives (mine arrived within a couple of days) connect to computer with iDrive backup software installed
6. Select the external iDrive hard disk as the backup destination
7. Select the data you wish to backup to iDrive.  This process will vary, however typically select the highest root folder of data you wish to backup to capture as much as possible
8. Backup your data.  Even with physical media, iDrive backups run with a number of checks and verifications during the process to ensure data integrity.  Even though I had a WD elements external USB 3.0 drive capable of over 100 MB/s, my backup never exceeded 30 MB/s.  This is by design per the iDrive rep I spoke with about this.
10. Once backup is complete, exit iDrive software and eject external drive
11. Pack the drive back into original packaging and ship back to iDrive
12. Once drive is recieved at the datacenter, iDrive technicians will begin uploading your backup into your account
13. Once upload has been completed, data will be available for viewing in the iDrive desktop app as well as online via your idrive web portal
