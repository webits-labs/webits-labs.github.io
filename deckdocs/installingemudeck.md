# How to install EmuDeck 

## Story:
Emudeck is an all in one Console Emulator management system.  If you are familiar with Batocera or RetroPi operating systems,
for that all in one emulator manager, this is the locally installed version of that.  

The benefit of installing EmuDeck vs booting a separate OS is the integration with Steam, such as the controller configurations, FSR, and GameScope to name a few.
However, there are benefits of booting all of your Roms via a dedicated device such as an SD card, so check out <Link to article> to set up Batocera for the Deck
