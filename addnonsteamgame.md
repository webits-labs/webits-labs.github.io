# How to add a non steam game on the Steam Deck

## Step 1: Finding and adding the game to Steam Client
1. Switch from GameMode to Desktop Mode -> Power -> "Switch to Desktop"
2. Open Steam client -> Inventory
3. Lower left hand corner -> Click "+" icon -> Click "Add non steam game"
4. There are 2 options to add a game/program to steam client:
   - Opt A: If game/program is selectable from the list: locate and check the box -> click OK
   - Opt B: If game/program is NOT selectable from the list: Click "Browse" -> Navigate to your app -> Click OK

Congratulations, the simple part has been completed, and you will now see your non steam game added to your list of installed games in Steam Client

## Step 2: Configuring and customizing game settings
1. Select the newly added game -> click the "Gear" icon -> Click "Properties"
2. Change the name of the application so that it matches the actual application name
   - This is important later for controller configurations, game art, etc
   - I.E. "myappname.exe" -> -> "Official Game Name"
3. Change the proton version if applicable.
   - Generally GE and Experimental are the latest versions of Proton and recommended trying these two first
5.  Exit out of game properties
6.  Click the "Controller" icon to edit controller configuration
   - Typically the "Gamepad" template is the default, depending on your application you can leave this as is
   - To add mouse control, simply edit the controller config -> edit right trackpad -> change to *Mouse
   - To add mouse click to above, edit the trackpad to emulate mouse left click on short press, right click on long press
     <Insert gif of adding mouse settings>
   - If an existing template exists, select that template instead <link to changing controller templates>

Now that the bones have been setup, the last step is the add in some game art to blend in with the rest of the library

## Step 3: Adding Game Art
1. If not already installed, <install Decky Plugin> and SteamGridDB add-on
2. Exit Desktop mode and enter GameMode
3. Highlight your newly added game -> press "Start" button -> press "Change Artwork"
4. Go through the top row to select your preferred art
5. Exit, and if prompted to restart Steam after changing the Icon graphic, select Yes (or No if changing multiple, save time by restarting after the last game has been changed)

## Conclusion:
By completing the steps above, you should now have a newly added game/program available in both GameMode and Desktop Mode with Proton and controller configurations and game ar
Repeat for any future games/programs you wish to access in game mode.  Some examples include:
  - Heroic Launcher
  - Dolphin File Explorer
  - Discover app updater
  - Terminal
  - Space Cadet Pinball (Available in Discover :smile:)
